Bug Fixes
=========


             Custom plugins that called ``cms.utils.plugins.copy_plugins_to`` or
             ``cms.models.pluginmodel.CMSPlugin.copy_plugins`` may have relied on the
             incorrect behaviour. Check your code for calls to these methods. Correctly
             implemented calls should expect the original plugin instance to remain
             unaltered.
