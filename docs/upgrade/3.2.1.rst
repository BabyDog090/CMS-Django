3.2.1 release notes
###################

*******************
What's new in 3.2.1
*******************

Improvements
============

- Add support for Django 1.9 (with some deprecation warnings).
- Add support for django-reversion 1.10+ (required by Django 1.9+).
- Fix a bug where page tree styles didn't load from STATIC_URL that pointed to a different host.
- Fix an issue where the side-frame wouldn't refresh under some circumstances.
- Honour CMS_RAW_ID_USERS in GlobalPagePermissionAdmin.


Treebeard corruption
====================

Prior to 3.2.1 moving or pasting nested plugins would lead to some non-fatal
tree corruptions, raising an error when adding plugins under the newly
pasted plugins.

To fix these problems, upgrade to 3.2.1 and then run ``manage.py cms fix-tree``
command to repair the tree.


DjangoCMS Text CKEditor
=======================

Action required
---------------
CMS 3.2.1 is not compatible with djangocms-text-ckeditor < 2.8.1.
If you're using djangocms-text-ckeditor, please upgrade to 2.8.1 or up.
